It is not a Takeshima. It's wrong expression.
And It's not just a Liancourt Rocks.
Only 20% of world map are use right name of Dokdo.

Japan falsely claims to the world that Dokdo belongs to them.
How about we show them the facts?
In case you go abroad and the topic comes up, you should present them with the facts !

Geographically, Dokdo is closer to Korea than it is to Japan.
From the Korean coast line, it is 87km, and form the Japanese coast line, it is 157km.

There is plenty of historical documentation of Dokdo being Korean territory.
The history of Dokdo can be found from sixth century Silla Dynasty all the way up to 1900.
Even Japan has these historical records, but keep them hidden.
In year 1905, Japan occupied Dokdo for strategic purposes.
This is when Japan began its occupation of Korea.
Finally, when Japan was defeated in World War2, it officially ended its occupation of Korea under the Treaty of San Francisco.

Japan says, According to the Treaty of San Francisco, Japan recognizing the independence of Korea including Jejudo, Komundo, and Ulleungdo have all been returned to Korea.
It doesn't say anything about Dokdo!
-> Apparently, this is their biggest argument behind their claim over Dokdo.

Don't worry Just respond like this.
So in the Treaty of San Francisco only a few major islands were listed because Korea has like 3000 islands!
So, wait a second, Does that mean all those other islands are also Japanese territory?
And explain to me why you have to have a passport to visit the island.
Let that sink in!
